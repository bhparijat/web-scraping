      "Great small shop with friendly service with a smile!    This was our first visit walking around the area of Glenn Park, close to the BART station, pretty clean and safe neighborhood.    We got the 1/2 lb of parmesiano reggiano was for shredding on top of a pasta dish was melt in your mouth goodness (invest in a  microplane, is a small grater that you will love for this purpose).  The 1/2 lb double creme Gouda was mild and smooth was for a cracker cheese and salami appetizer with also the 1/2 lb orange cheese with chives and onions was so unique and delicious. total was under $20.     Gourmet pastas, maple syrup, found red currant jelly for $4 for a rib recipe I've been wanting to try.  The have triple creme brie, too rich for guests to devour, but maybe next time!\n",
      "\n",
      "Super friendly people, great selection of specialty items and cheese. I've got two suggestions that could put this place over the top for lunch (and certainly win over more of my business). 1. The baguettes suck. They rip your mouth apart and are way too hard for a sandwich, all the meats/cheese slide out because of the amount of force you have to pack behind your bite. I've had sandwiches with their baguettes multiple times so I know it wasn't just a bad batch. 2. Toast the sammies! I'm sure anyone would be willing to wait the extra couple of minutes and they would be super awesome heated up.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's CLOSED!  No sign, no notice.  This wonderful little cheese shop seemed to pack up overnight and disappear!   I went by on Monday on my morning walk and was really disappointed to see it was gone... not remodeling.. not moving but GONE.  Such a shame.  Now it seems as if the Roxie Market at 9th and Kirkham is the closest place for British fare.  And for cheese ,,,there's the cheese place on Portola near Teresita (if Canyyon Market doesn't have what you want) ... a bit far to go for either.  Most of the Italian sutff can be found at Lucca's over in the Mission.This place will be missed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't go here for variety!  Go here because they have very good sandwiches made-to-order, AND They have a nice selection of VERY good quality cheeses, many imported, and all of them FRESH!It's not SIZE that counts in this case..it's quality, and the smiles you get from the owner, who's a nice man who knows how to treat his clients.(On a side note..some of the novelty items are a buck or two more than you can get elsewhere, I assume that's because you are paying for goods in a remote neighborhood..a bit like Hawaii that charges more because you are isolated)\n",
      "\n",
      "They reopened!  Next door!    So right now the awning for the cheese boutique hangs over an empty store front and next door is the new Cheese Boutique.  Apparently there were some issues with the landlord and the new space wasn't ready at the same time they had to vacate the old spot.I am glad to see they are back.  The new spot is much smaller and their aren't as many specialty groceries as there were before, but I can't wait to shop there again.\n",
      "\n",
      "By far the BEST sandwiches in Glen Park. Abetted by a sweet couple who are friendly, helpful and thoughtful. And I have to disagree with another reviewer: I love their baguettes. I always get my sandwiches on them. Tasty, chewy... this is what bread should be.I bring sandwiches to my mom (in her 80's) on the peninsula from time to time, and she always comments on how good they are. The neighborhood is fortunate to have this shop!\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been looking for a truly awesome sandwich place ever since I moved to the city a few months back. I've tried them all, and I must say Cheese Boutique is among the best. They've got a small family operation going, and you can really taste the love in them cold cuts. The sandwiches also aren't that big, but the quality you get for the price is unlike any other place in the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE CHEESE BOUTIQUE IS STILL IN GLEN PARK!They aren't gone; they just moved one door up the street. The new place is a little smaller, but they still have the great sandwiches, and they carry all the stuff that Canyon Market doesn't carry. Plus they have all the cheese, of course! Great local place, super nice and fantastic owners, and the best hummus EVER.\n",
      "\n",
      "The people who run this place are the best.  The cheese selection is awesome and reasonably priced compared to other cheese places, and their assortment of foreign candies etc. are dangerous :).Sandwiches are also delicious and the bread is freshly baked from a bakery around the corner.They also compile great \"goodie\" baskets for holiday/thank you gifts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Excellent small local business.  Nick will hook you up with whatever you need.  I'm not a cheese expert, but I can go in there and tell him how many people we're having over and whatnot, and he'll hook us up with the right amount and variety...    Great service, great product.  I'm glad they've been able to hang on since Canyon Market opened.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had a delicious Italian combo sandwich here. Everything from the bread to the meats to the cheese to even the mustard made it the most melt in your mouth, leaves you wanting more, can't believe all other sandwiches aren't like this kind of sandwich. Highly recommended. I'm just sad I didn't get to try the hummus.\n",
      "\n",
      "One the best small businesses in SF.  This husband and wife duo are knowledgeable, friendly and great at their craft.  Try the hummus and/ or  salmon spread that is made fresh daily, you will not be disappointed.  The small batch jams and jellies that are locally sourced are also on my list of must haves.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had a delicious sandwich, but my wife and I felt intimidated by the service--it was our first time in the shop and we didn't know all the ins and outs of ordering a sandwich here which seemed to have put them off. Overall, I would get another sandwich here if I was in town.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been shopping at Cheese Boutique for years. The owners are absolutely wonderful people, very genuine, very friendly to everybody. The cheese selection is great and the homemade middle eastern food is always fresh and delicious. They also make great party platters.\n",
      "\n",
      "A small selection of cheese, but it's very good and the prices are excellent.  The mortadella is the best I have ever had, and the fresh-sliced pancetta is also very good.  Also bought some great frozen ravioli.The staff is young but knowledgeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "This store is my #1 spot for sandwiches and hummus!  Not to mention their superb cheese selection.  Great service, excellent quality- a real San Francisco gem.  Definitely check this place out for lots and lots of goodies.Thank you Cheese Boutique!\n",
      "\n",
      "This place is great, terrific cheeses and deli meats.  I have reviewed it before, but I'm just writing this to point out that all of the photos are from the old location a few doors down, so don't go looking for the awning in that photo.\n",
      "\n",
      "A  compact store that packs a BIG service.   Knowledgeable staff, quality selection of cheese and choice groceries; even fresh baguettes from a local bakery, delicious deli sandwiches and the very best customer focused service.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amazing selection of cheeses and other mezze. The staff was extremely helpful and let us taste to our heart's content! Great neighborhood, parking and walking around was a breeze. Was so glad to walk into this delicious shop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Delicious sandwiches, excellent cheese selection, knowledgable, helpful, friendly staff, and those lavash crackers are a fabulous delivery system for their meat, cheese, and spread selections.\n",
